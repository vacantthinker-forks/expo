Expo Application Services (EAS) is the next-generation of services that unlock new opportunities for improving your apps and development processes.

There are two services currently available under "Feature Preview" to [EAS Priority plan subscribers](https://expo.io/pricing):

- **EAS Build**: Compile and sign Android/iOS apps with custom native code in the cloud. Easily distribute your apps to testers without waiting for TestFlight or Google Play. [Learn more](/build/introduction.md).

- **EAS Submit**: Upload your app to the Apple App Store or Google Play Store from the cloud with one CLI command. [Learn more](/submit/introduction.md).
