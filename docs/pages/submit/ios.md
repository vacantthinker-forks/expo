This guide outlines how to submit your app to the Apple App Store from your own computer and from CI.

## Prerequisites

A paid developer account is required to submit an app &mdash; you can create an Apple Developer account on the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/).

## 1. Build a standalone app

You'll need a native app binary signed for store submission. You can either use the [EAS Build](introduction.md) service or do it on your own. You will also need to have EAS CLI installed and authenticated with your Expo account: `npm install -g eas-cli & eas login`.

## 2. Start the submission

To submit the binary to the App Store, run `eas submit -p ios` from inside your project directory. The command will lead you step by step through the process of submitting the app. To see all possible options along with example usages, run `eas submit --help`.

> Although it's possible to upload any binary to the store, each submission is assigned to an Expo project. That's why it's important to start submission from inside your project's directory - that's where your [app configuration](../workflow/configuration.md) is defined.

**Important**: You'll have to generate an [Apple app-specific-password](https://expo.fyi/apple-app-specific-password) before uploading an app using EAS CLI.

To upload your iOS app to the Apple App Store, run `eas submit --platform ios` and follow the instructions on the screen.

The command will perform the following steps:

- Log in to Expo account and ensure that your app project exists on EAS servers
- Ensure that your app exists on App Store Connect and its [Bundle Identifier](https://expo.fyi/bundle-identifier) is registered on Apple Developer Portal:

  - You will be asked to log in your Apple Developer account and select your team. You can also provide this information by using the `--apple-id`, `--apple-team-id` params and the `EXPO_APPLE_PASSWORD` environment variable.
  - The command will look for `ios.bundleIdentifier` in your app configuration, or you can provide it directly using the `--bundle-identifier` flag.
  - If you are submitting your app for the first time, it will be automatically created.
    Unless `expo.name` in your app configuration is found or an `--app-name` param is provided, you will be prompted for app name.
    You can also specify your app's language and SKU using `--language` and `--sku` params respectively. If you have never submitted any app before, you may also have to specify your company name using `--company-name` parameter.

  > If you already have an App Store Connect app, this step can be skipped by providing the `--asc-app-id` param. The [ASC App Id](https://expo.fyi/asc-app-id) param can be found either on App Store Connect, or later during this command in the _Submission Summary_ table.

- Ask for your Apple ID (if not provided earlier) and for your Apple app-specific password. They can be also provided using `--apple-id` param and `EXPO_APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` environment variable, respectively.
- Ask for which binary to submit. You can select one of the following:

  - The latest successful iOS build for the project on EAS servers
  - Specific build ID. The ID can be found on the [builds dashboard](https://expo.io/builds?type=eas)
  - Path to an `.ipa` archive on your local filesystem
  - URL to the app archive

  > This step can be skipped, if one of the following parameters is provided: `--latest`, `--id`, `--path` or `--url`.

- A summary of the provided configuration is displayed and the submission process begins. The submission progress is displayed on the screen.
- Your build should now be visible on [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com). If something goes wrong, an appropriate message is displayed on the screen.

## Submitting your app using CI

The `eas submit` command is able to perform submissions from a CI environment. All you have to do is ensure that all required information is provided with command parameters and environment variables. Mainly, providing the archive source (`--latest`, `--id`, `--path` or `--url`) is essential. Also, make sure that the iOS Bundle Identifier is present in your [app configuration file](/workflow/configuration.md), unless you provide the `--bundle-identifier` flag.

For iOS submissions, you have to provide `EXPO_APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` environment variable along with Apple ID (`--apple-id`) and ASC App ID (`--asc-app-id`) parameters. The `--asc-app-id` flag is required to skip Apple developer login, which will likely not be possible on CI due to the 2FA prompt.

Example usage:

```sh
EXPO_APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=xxxxx eas submit -p ios --latest --apple-id=user@example.com --asc-app-id=1234567890
```
