# Reference

## Methods

### `share()`

```js
static share(content, options)
```

Open a dialog to share text content.

In iOS, returns a Promise which will be invoked with an object containing `action` and `activityType`. If the user dismissed the dialog, the Promise will still be resolved with action being `Share.dismissedAction` and all the other keys being undefined. Note that some share options will not appear or work on the iOS simulator.

In Android, returns a Promise which will always be resolved with action being `Share.sharedAction`.

### Content

- `message` - a message to share

#### iOS

- `url` - an URL to share

At least one of URL and message is required.

#### Android

- `title` - title of the message

### Options

#### iOS

- `subject` - a subject to share via email
- `excludedActivityTypes`
- `tintColor`

#### Android

- `dialogTitle`

---

### `sharedAction()`

```js
static sharedAction
```

The content was successfully shared.

---

### `dismissedAction()`

```js
static dismissedAction
```

_**iOS-only**_. The dialog has been dismissed.
