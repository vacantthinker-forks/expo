This module provides utilities for helping you gracefully handle crashes due to fatal JavaScript errors.

<PlatformsSection android emulator ios simulator web />

## Installation

<InstallSection packageName="expo-error-recovery" />

## API

```js
import * as ErrorRecovery from 'expo-error-recovery';
```

### `ErrorRecovery.setRecoveryProps(props)`

Set arbitrary error recovery props. If your project crashes in production as a result of a fatal JS error, Expo will reload your project. If you've set these props, they'll be passed to your reloaded project's initial props under `exp.errorRecovery`. Access to `localStorage` is required on web, or else this will simply be a no-op.

[Read more about error handling with Expo](../../../guides/errors.md).

#### Arguments

- **props (_object_)** -- An object which will be passed to your reloaded project's initial props if the project was reloaded as a result of a fatal JS error.
