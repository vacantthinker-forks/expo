Screen Orientation is defined as the orientation in which graphics are painted on the device. For example, the figure below has a device in a vertical and horizontal physical orientation, but a portrait screen orientation. For physical device orientation, see the orientation section of [Device Motion](devicemotion.md).

<ImageSpotlight alt="Portrait orientation in different physical orientations" src="/static/images/screen-orientation-portrait.png" containerStyle={{ backgroundColor: palette.light.gray['300'] }}  />

`ScreenOrientation` from **`expo`** allows changing supported screen orientations at runtime, and subscribing to orientation changes. This will take priority over the `orientation` key in `app.json`.

On both iOS and Android platforms, changes to the screen orientation will override any system settings or user preferences. On Android, it is possible to change the screen orientation while taking the user's preferred orientation into account. On iOS, user and system settings are not accessible by the application and any changes to the screen orientation will override existing settings.

> Web support has [limited support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=deviceorientation). For improved resize detection on mobile Safari, check out the docs on using [Resize Observer in Expo web](../../../guides/customizing-webpack.md#resizeobserver).

## Installation

<InstallSection packageName="expo-screen-orientation" />

### Warning

Apple added support for _split view_ mode to iPads in iOS 9. This changed how the screen orientation is handled by the system. To put the matter shortly, for the iOS, your iPad is always in the landscape mode unless you open two applications side by side. In order to be able to lock screen orientation using this module you will need to disable support for this feature. For more information about the _split view_ mode, check out [the official Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207582).

#### Managed workflow

Open your `app.json` and add the following inside of the `"expo"` field:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "ios": {
      ...
      "requireFullScreen": true,
    }
  }
}
```

#### Bare workflow

Tick the `Requires Full Screen` checkbox in Xcode. It should be located under `Project Target > General > Deployment Info`.

## API

```js
import * as ScreenOrientation from 'expo-screen-orientation';
```

## Methods

### `ScreenOrientation.lockAsync(orientationLock)`

Lock the screen orientation to a particular OrientationLock.

#### Arguments

- **orientationLock (_OrientationLock_)** -- The orientation lock to apply. See the [`OrientationLock`](#screenorientationorientationlock) enum for possible values.

#### Returns

Returns a promise with `void` value, resolving when the orientation is set.

#### Error Codes

- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_INVALID_ORIENTATION_LOCK` - an invalid [`OrientationLock`](#screenorientationorientationlock) was passed in.
- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_UNSUPPORTED_ORIENTATION_LOCK` - the platform does not support the orientation lock policy.
- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_MISSING_ACTIVITY` - could not get the current activity (**Android only**).

#### Example

```javascript
async function changeScreenOrientation() {
  await ScreenOrientation.lockAsync(ScreenOrientation.OrientationLock.LANDSCAPE_LEFT);
}
```

### `ScreenOrientation.lockPlatformAsync(platformInfo)`

#### Arguments

- **platformInfo (_PlatformOrientationInfo_)** -- The platform specific lock to apply. See the [`PlatformOrientationInfo`](#screenorientationplatformorientationinfo) object type for the different platform formats.

#### Returns

Returns a promise with `void` value, resolving when the orientation is set and rejecting if an invalid option or value is passed.

#### Error Codes

- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_INVALID_ORIENTATION_LOCK` - an invalid [`OrientationLock`](#screenorientationorientationlock) was passed in (**iOS only**).
- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_UNSUPPORTED_ORIENTATION_LOCK` - the platform does not support the orientation lock policy.
- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_MISSING_ACTIVITY` - could not get the current activity (**Android only**).

### `ScreenOrientation.unlockAsync()`

Sets the screen orientation back to the `OrientationLock.DEFAULT` policy.

#### Error Codes

- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_MISSING_ACTIVITY` - could not get the current activity (**Android only**).

#### Returns

Returns a promise with `void` value, resolving when the orientation is set.

### `ScreenOrientation.getOrientationAsync()`

Gets the current screen orientation.

#### Returns

Returns a promise that resolves to an [`Orientation`](#screenorientationorientation) value that reflects the current screen orientation.

#### Error Codes

- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_GET_ORIENTATION_LOCK` - An unknown error occurred when trying to get the system lock. (**Android only**)
- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_MISSING_ACTIVITY` - could not get the current activity (**Android only**).

### `ScreenOrientation.getOrientationLockAsync()`

Gets the current screen orientation lock type.

#### Returns

Returns a promise with an [`OrientationLock`](#screenorientationorientationlock) value.

#### Error Codes

- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_MISSING_ACTIVITY` - could not get the current activity (**Android only**).

### `ScreenOrientation.getPlatformOrientationLockAsync()`

Gets the platform specific screen orientation lock type.

#### Returns

Returns a promise with a [`PlatformOrientationInfo`](#screenorientationplatformorientationinfo) value.

#### Error Codes

- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_GET_PLATFORM_ORIENTATION_LOCK`
- `ERR_SCREEN_ORIENTATION_MISSING_ACTIVITY` - could not get the current activity (**Android only**).

### `ScreenOrientation.supportsOrientationLockAsync(orientationLock)`

Returns whether the [`OrientationLock`](#screenorientationorientationlock) policy is supported on the device.

#### Returns

Returns a promise that resolves to a `boolean` value that reflects whether or not the orientationLock is supported.

### `ScreenOrientation.addOrientationChangeListener(listener)`

Invokes the `listener` function when the screen orientation changes from `portrait` to `landscape` or from `landscape` to `portrait`. For example, it won't be invoked when screen orientation change from `portrait up` to `portrait down`, but it will be called when there was a change from `portrait up` to `landscape left`.

#### Arguments

- **listener (_OrientationChangeListener_)**
  - Each orientation update will pass an object with the new [`OrientationChangeEvent`](#screenorientationorientationchangeevent) to the listener.

#### Returns

Returns an [`Subscription`](#subscription) object that can later be used to unsubscribe updates to the listener.

### `ScreenOrientation.removeOrientationChangeListeners()`

Removes all listeners subscribed to orientation change updates.

### `ScreenOrientation.removeOrientationChangeListener(subscription)`

Unsubscribes the listener associated with the `subscription` object from all orientation change updates.

#### Arguments

- **subscription (_Subscription_)**
  - A subscription object that manages the updates passed to a listener function on an orientation change.

## Enum types

### `ScreenOrientation.Orientation`

- **`Orientation.UNKNOWN`** - An unknown screen orientation. For example, the device is flat, perhaps on a table.
- **`Orientation.PORTRAIT_UP`** - Right-side up portrait interface orientation.
- **`Orientation.PORTRAIT_DOWN`** - Upside down portrait interface orientation.
- **`Orientation.LANDSCAPE_LEFT`** - Left landscape interface orientation.
- **`Orientation.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT`** - Right landscape interface orientation.

### `ScreenOrientation.OrientationLock`

An enum whose values can be passed to the [`lockAsync`](#screenorientationlockasyncorientationlock) method.

- **`OrientationLock.DEFAULT`** -- The default orientation. On iOS, this will allow all orientations except `Orientation.PORTRAIT_DOWN`. On Android, this lets the system decide the best orientation.
- **`OrientationLock.ALL`** -- All four possible orientations
- **`OrientationLock.PORTRAIT`** -- Any portrait orientation.
