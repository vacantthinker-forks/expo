# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
expo install expo-cellular
```

### Configure for Android

This package requires the `android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE` be added to your `AndroidManifest.xml`, this is used for `TelephonyManager` on Android. We **do not** require the more risky `READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE` permission.

```xml
<!-- Added permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
```
