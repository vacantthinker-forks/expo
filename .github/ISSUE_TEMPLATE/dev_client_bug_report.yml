      placeholder: Clearly describe what the expected behavior is vs. what is actually happening. This should be as short as possible, while still communicating all the necessary information.

      description: 'This should include as little code as possible, do not simply link your entire project. If a reproducible demo, or a complete list of steps from blank project to bug, is not provided, it is very likely your issue will be closed. If you link to a project that contains multiple non-Expo-core modules, it is unlikely to help us narrow down the cause of your issue more quickly.
